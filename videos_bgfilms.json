He reached out when I only had a few thousand subscribers, offering me encouragement, ideas, and inspiring words. He even gave me the idea for the Big Kahuna Burger episode from Pulp Fiction. Garmt was also suffering from the later stages of Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis, or ALS - he wrote a blog where he detailed his experience, peppered with a humor, positivity, and bravery. He started fundraisers, spoke at events, and continually inspired and enlivened everyone around him, including myself.\n\nGarmt died on Monday, October 23rd. He messaged me on Friday to say goodbye - I openly wept in the airport TGI Friday's, asked him if there was anything I could do, if I could come visit before he left us - he wanted to spend his last few days with his loving family. He only wanted to tell me \"thank you one last time for the joy of cooking you shared with me and the world...and I'm pissed that I got no credit in your book! :D\". Even at the end, he could crack a joke. Garmt inspired and continues to inspire people all over the globe, and after watching him take the ice bucket challenge back in 2014 (https://youtu.be/dKSB1_enQWE) , he's inspired me to take that campaign in a different direction - the hot pepper challenge. The concept is the same - nominate your friends and family to endure, instead of a bucket of ice water, a pepper as hot as they can handle - the hotter the pepper, the less money they're required to donate. No matter what, each nominee must nominate 3 others to take the challenge. I hope that this will help raise funds and awareness for the ALS Association, a great organization doing important work researching the disease.

Add onions, saut\u00e9 until translucent, add tomato paste and garlic and saut\u00e9 until fragrant. Deglaze with wine, scraping up all the good stuff on the bottom of the pot.  Add tomatoes, crushing with a spoon (or processing with a food mill if desired), and return meats to the pot.  Add basil and carrot, and bring to a bare simmer.  Let sauce simmer for hours, stirring and scraping the bottom occasionally (don't let anything stick - it will scorch and ruin your sauce).  Add meatballs during the final hour of cooking, and simmer until desired consistency is reached.\n\nRemove carrots and beef/veal bones - add a spoonful of sauce to coat some freshly-cooked pasta (preferably something ridged so it holds onto lots of sauce), and serve with meat and extra gravy.  Top with parmesan.

Recipe below!\n\nMusic: \"Cream on Chrome\" by Ratatat\n\nRECIPE\n---\n\n*Ingredients*\n-3 cloves garlic, cut paper-thin\n-3 small onions (keyword: small) chopped\n-1 lb each sweet and spicy italian sausage\n-1 beef shank\n-1lb veal neck bones w/ meat attached\n-1 glug red wine\n-3 cans DOP San Marzano tomatoes\n-1 tbsp tomato paste\n-2 large stems fresh basil\n-1 large carrot, peeled and cut into big chunks\n-1lb meatballs\n-Olive oil or butter for finishing (optional)\n-Parmesan cheese (not optional)\n\n*Method*\n\nIn a large stock pot, brown the sausage, beef, and veal in batches until well browned and fond has formed on the bottom of the pot.  Add onions, saut\u00e9 until translucent, add tomato paste and garlic and saut\u00e9 until fragrant. Deglaze with wine, scraping up all the good stuff on the bottom of the pot.  Add tomatoes, crushing with a spoon (or processing with a food mill if desired), and return meats to the pot.  Add basil and carrot, and bring to a bare simmer.  Let sauce simmer for hours, stirring and scraping the bottom occasionally (don't let anything stick - it will scorch and ruin your sauce).  Add meatballs during the final hour of cooking, and simmer until desired consistency is reached.\n\nRemove carrots and beef/veal bones - add a spoonful of sauce to coat some freshly-cooked pasta (preferably something ridged so it holds onto lots of sauce), and serve with meat and extra gravy.  Top with parmesan.  Eat.\n\nBinging With Babish Website: http://bit.ly/BingingBabishWebsite\nBasics With Babish Website: http://bit.ly/BasicsWithBabishWebsite\nPatreon: http://bit.ly/BingingPatreon\nInstagram: http://bit.ly/BabishInstagram\nFacebook: http://bit.ly/BabishFacebook\nTwitter: http://bit.ly/BabishTwitter"}}, "kind": "youtube#video", "statistics": {"likeCount": "53976", "dislikeCount": "662", "viewCount": "4579776", "commentCount": "1581", "favoriteCount": "0"}, "id": "uEjMyHccX8U"}, {"contentDetails": {"licensedContent": false, "dimension": "2d", "caption": "true", "projection": "rectangular", "definition": "hd", "duration": "PT6M5S"}, "etag": "\"XpPGQXPnxQJhLgs6enD_n8JR4Qk/oqgAX8_4iXF3z6jGu-gFmD03CwA\"", "snippet": {"title": "Binging with Babish: The Moistmaker from Friends", "description": "I never watched Friends but I couldn't google \"thanksgiving sandwiches in television and film\" without getting about a billion Ross Geller references.
